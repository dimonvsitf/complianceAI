Document should have a title "Beneficial Ownership and Source of Wealth"

Provide a comprehensive analysis of ownership structures, noting that these can range from a single direct owner to intricate, multi-level ownership chains spanning multiple jurisdictions.

Ensure that each ownership layer is clearly identified, including direct and indirect shareholders, holding companies, venture capital investors, and any associated individuals.

Highlight the reasoning behind categorizing certain individuals as UBOs and clarify cases where KYC is not required due to non-controlling interests.

Reference and document official data sources used for verification (e.g., corporate registries, government-issued documents, regulatory filings such as ASIC extracts, SEC Form ADV, etc.). Include any publicly available profiles (e.g., LinkedIn) and websites of entities involved.

# Ownership Structure

-   **Scope of Structures:**
    -   Clearly state whether the structure is simple (e.g., a single individual directly owning the entity) or complex (multi-level, cross-border corporate chains).

-   **Multi-Level Ownership Breakdown (if applicable):**
    -   List all shareholders (individuals, corporations, venture capital firms) at each layer of the corporate chain.
    -   For each layer, specify the ownership percentages and identify any recent changes.
    -   Include verification details (e.g., "as evidenced by Confirmation of Shareholders document", "Confirmed by Registry Extract from ASIC" or "Referenced from SEC Form ADV").
    -   Identify UBOs by following the ownership chain: starting from the top-level holding entities down to individuals.
    -   Highlight any split ownership details (e.g., multiple partial shareholders, some holding less than a significant threshold).
    -   Distinguish between controlling and non-controlling investors, noting if certain owners have limited influence (e.g., venture capital funds that do not exercise control).
    -   For each company in the ownership structure (other than the applicant company), specify their website (if available).

•   The link to the full form: https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov

•   Website of QUADPARTNERS V LP. is: https://www.quadpartners.com/
•   The prospect has confirmed that QUAD PARTNERS V LP does not control the company in any way and that they only provided financing to start the Australian company QUANTUM IT GLOBAL HOLDINGS PTY LTD. as part of its venture capital activities. Therefore the KYC for the UBO Lincoln Frank isn't required and his name isn't added on the ownership strucre on the WA.
